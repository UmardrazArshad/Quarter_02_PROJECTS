            "* **Plan:** Figure out the steps needed to reach the goal.\n",
            "* **Decide:** Choose the best actions based on the context and its understanding of the situation.\n",
            "* **Execute:** Take those actions, potentially interacting with other systems, data, or even the real world.\n",
            "* **Adapt:** Learn from its experiences and refine its approach over time.\n",

            "* **Goal-Oriented:** Driven by specific objectives and actively works towards achieving them.\n",
            "* **Planning & Reasoning:** Can think ahead, strategize, and use logic to make decisions.\n",
            "* **Action & Execution:** Capable of performing actions that affect its environment.\n",
            "* **Learning & Adaptation:** Can improve its performance through experience.\n",
            "* **Perception:** Can interpret and understand its environment through sensors or data.\n",

These systems are typically reactive and follow predefined rules. Agentic AI, on the other hand, is more proactive and can take initiative to achieve complex goals.\n",

            "* **To provide clear and comprehensive guidance:** The Quran is considered the ultimate source of guidance for Muslims. It offers detailed instructions on all aspects of life, from worship and personal conduct to social interactions and legal matters. It addresses the fundamental questions of human existence: Who is God? Why are we here? What is our purpose?\n",
            "* **To distinguish between right and wrong:** The Quran provides a clear framework for understanding morality and ethics. It distinguishes between good and evil, truth and falsehood, and encourages people to choose the path of righteousness.\n",
            "* **To establish a just and equitable society:** The Quran promotes principles of justice, fairness, and compassion. It advocates for the rights of all individuals, regardless of their social status, gender, or ethnicity.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **To affirm the core message of previous prophets:** The Quran acknowledges the validity of earlier scriptures, such as the Torah (revealed to Moses) and the Gospel (revealed to Jesus). It confirms the core message of monotheism (belief in one God) that was preached by all prophets.\n",
            "* **To correct distortions and alterations:** Over time, previous scriptures had been subject to human interpretation, translation, and alterations. The Quran came to clarify these distortions and to present the true message of God in its purest form.\n",
            "* **To be the final and complete revelation:** The Quran is considered the final and complete revelation from God to humanity. It abrogates previous laws and scriptures where necessary, and provides a comprehensive code of conduct for all times.\n",
