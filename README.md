# LangChain and Google Gemini Flash 2.0 Integration

This project demonstrates the integration of LangChain and Google Gemini Flash 2.0 exp for advanced natural language processing tasks.

## Process

1. **Installation:** Install the necessary libraries: `langchain`, `langchain-google-genai`, and `langchain-community`.
2. **Initialization:** Initialize the Google Gemini Flash 2.0 exp model using `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` from `langchain_google_genai`. Set your Google API key for authentication.
3. **Prompt Template:** Create a prompt template using `PromptTemplate` from `langchain.prompts`. This template guides the model's responses.
4. **LLM Chain:** Construct an LLM chain using `LLMChain` from `langchain.chains`. This chain links the prompt template and the Gemini Flash 2.0 exp model.
5. **Question Answering:** Define a function to ask questions and receive responses from the LLM chain.
6. **Advanced Prompting:** Experiment with advanced prompt templates to enhance the model's responses.
7. **Summarization:** Implement a summarization feature using another LLM chain to generate summaries of previous responses.

## Outcomes

- **Agentic AI:** The model provided information on the concept of Agentic AI.
- **Religious Inquiry:** The model declined to answer a question about religious matters, stating its focus on data science, machine learning, and coding.
- **Historical Figures:** The model declined to provide a definitive answer about the greatest personality in history, stating that there are many important personalities in the history of mankind.
- **Advanced Responses:** Advanced prompt engineering led to more insightful and concise responses.
- **Summarization:** The summarization feature effectively summarized responses generated throughout the process.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the capabilities of LangChain and Google Gemini Flash 2.0 exp for building robust and flexible NLP applications. It demonstrates question answering, advanced prompting, and summarization features, while also highlighting the model's boundaries in handling sensitive topics.
